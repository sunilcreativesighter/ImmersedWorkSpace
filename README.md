**Statement-** 
```
The task is to create the following:
1) A floor plan + concept drawings (different angles) of a 3D environment that a young professional would be excited to work in (feel free to take inspiration from environments in apps like Oculus Home and vTime).
 
2) Create 3 interesting objects in 3D from your concept (Unity-compatible), while considering optimizations for mobile VR. Or, feel free to create the environment itself (to be more impressive), but we'd like you to err on the side of speed. Please send all asset files so we can profile your work and test it in VR.
 
3) Please include a brief write-up that discusses your planning process for #1, and your thought process for #2 (including optimizations you considered and executed).
 
Bonus: Use a shader to add a unique effect to the environment. Even make your own custom shader if possible.

**Solution**
```
Proposing an environment here that would be a dream place for a young professional to sit and work.


As a lighting specialist, I love to work on magic hour lighting in view of the fact that I can make use of both the environment and internal lights to lit an environment unlike day or night environments.


For the same, I tried to draw a layout (a very rough sketch in my notebook) and with the help of Illustrator later to visualize it better.


While the concept started to flow, I was more influenced to make it more obviously artificial that is the reason we see, artificial type plants, and artificial type flowers with lights all around instead of realistic-looking foliage.


To make it more appealing and to make the users non-sleepy, more colors were important and which is why we see some Hot air balloons


You can even experience the spatial sound of Fire when the user goes near to it.


Although I can create some custom shaders, I couldnâ€™t find anything to be done for now.

**Optimization**
```
Most of the textures are atlased into unique ones which are also resulting a lesser number of materials.


Post-processing is being used to beautify the views - However, the lighting still supports even after the post-processing is turned off - If required


The number of lightmaps is optimized- This could have been further optimized with time.
